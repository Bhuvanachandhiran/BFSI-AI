LOAN RESTRUCTURING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

1. Definition and Scope

The Loan Restructuring Regulatory Framework refers to the structured mechanism through which an institution modifies the terms of a credit facility for borrowers experiencing financial stress. The Loan Restructuring Regulatory Framework ensures that relief measures are implemented without compromising asset quality recognition standards. All restructuring activities must be aligned with prudential norms, internal policy guidelines, and supervisory oversight requirements.

2. Regulatory Framework

The Loan Restructuring Regulatory Framework is governed by regulatory directives that establish eligibility conditions, asset classification treatment, and provisioning implications. Under this regulatory framework, restructuring may involve extension of tenure, modification of installment amounts, deferment of principal repayment, or conversion of unpaid interest into funded interest term loans.

The objective of the Loan Restructuring Regulatory Framework is to balance borrower viability with systemic financial stability. Institutions must conduct viability assessments before approving restructuring proposals.

3. Asset Classification Implications

Under the Loan Restructuring Regulatory Framework, restructured accounts may be subject to revised asset classification norms. Asset classification treatment depends on repayment performance post-restructuring.

Restructured exposures must be monitored to determine whether the account qualifies for standard asset treatment or remains in a stressed category under prudential norms.

4. Provisioning and Compliance Requirements

The Loan Restructuring Regulatory Framework mandates provisioning adjustments based on the asset category of the restructured account. Compliance requirements include maintaining adequate capital buffers and ensuring that provisioning norms reflect the underlying credit risk.

Institutions must document restructuring approvals, viability analysis, and risk assessments in accordance with internal policy guidelines and regulatory framework standards.

5. Reporting and Monitoring

Supervisory reporting of restructured accounts must be conducted periodically. The Loan Restructuring Regulatory Framework requires disclosure of restructuring volumes, asset quality migration, and provisioning adequacy.

A robust monitoring mechanism is required to prevent misuse of restructuring facilities and to maintain transparency within the regulatory framework.

6. Risk Management and Supervisory Oversight

The Loan Restructuring Regulatory Framework plays a critical role in risk management. Institutions must integrate restructuring data into credit risk models and capital adequacy planning.

Supervisory oversight ensures adherence to prudential norms and regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with the Loan Restructuring Regulatory Framework may result in supervisory action.
